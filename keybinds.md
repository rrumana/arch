# This is where my keybinds will go

This system is a work in progress. I am currently using Hyprland, Tmux, Neovim, so expect many keybinds.
Keybinds will be applied through the appropriate dotfiles, this is just a reference document.

I am actually not a very good typist, and I have implemented all of these keybinds in the last few months, so this is a big challenge for me. Hopefully after a few more months of struggling I will be able to efficiently navigate my new setup.
