# Arch

A repository containing everything related to my personal Arch setup

My laptop it terribly unstable (Curse you Lenovo) so this repo is mainly for me to document my setup as it evolves and make install scripts so that when I eventually have to reinstall everything it goes much quicker.

My theme colors will be based based on wallust (I love supporting Rust projects)

I am enjoying Noto Sans Mono but I might change that as well

I am currently working on removing all KDE applications from my stack and replacing them with lighter and more configurable alternatives. No hate just searching for a more custom look and feel

photos, dotfiles, and install script hopefully on the way

Currently just fastfetch is up, here is a list of programs I need to finish, document, and upload:
 - [ ] Hyprland as window manager (wayland)
 - [ ] Alacritty as terminal (Rust)
 - [ ] Wallust as theme manager (Rust)
 - [ ] Waybar as status bar
 - [ ] more...

I use Neovim as my text editor and I have a separate repo for that [here](https://github.com/rrumana/Neovim) 

I also will be adding my keybinds for everything in one file (for my reference and yours)

fastfetch cause why not
